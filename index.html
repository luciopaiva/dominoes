<h1>Domino Tiling</h1>

<p>Brute-force randomized algorithm to place dominoes and try to cover as much tiles as possible. It does not try
    obvious placements. Instead, it places dominoes randomly, hoping that in the end all tiles will be covered (a
    perfect match). In case of an imperfect match, it keeps trying for up to 10k attempts, when it gives up and shows
    the best it could do.</p>

<p class="important">Commands: click to add/remove dominoes, mouse wheel to rotate.</p>
